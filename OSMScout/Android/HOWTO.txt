# This How-To describes the needed software, environment settings and build
# procedure to get the libosmscout library built for Android.

1. Build environment and used software

  - Linux or Windows (not tested yet on other platforms).
  - Android SDK ADT Bundle r21.0.1 (developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
  - Android NDK r8d (http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html).


2. Environment variables 

In order to run the build scripts, set the ANDROID_NDK_PATH environment variable
to the Android NDK installation directory. Add also this directory to the
executable search PATH environmental variable.


3. Build the OsmScout JNI shared library

Go to the “libosmscout/Android/OsmScoutLib/jni” directory and run the build
script ("build.sh" on linux, "build.bat" on Windows). This script will copy
the configuration headers files (Config.h, CoreFeatures.h and MapFeatures.h),
build the libosmscout-arm static library and libosmscout-jni shared library.
At the end of the build process, the 
“libosmscout/Android/OsmScoutLib/libs/armeabi” directory shall contain both the
"libgnustl_shared.so" and "libosmscout-jni.so" shared libraries.


4. Importing the OsmScoutLib project into Eclipse workspace

On Eclipse IDE, import the OsmScoutLib project into your workspace via the
"File>>Import" menu, import source "General>>Existing Projects into Workspace",
select "libosmscout/Android" as root directory and choose the "OsmScoutLib" 
project to import. You can also import the "OsmScoutViewer" demo project.


5. Setting up the User's Project properties

Open the "Project Properties" window of your Android App project, select the
"Android" tab and add the "OsmScoutLib" to the list of library projects.


6. Current Android OsmScoutLib limitations

There're many libosmscout library functionalities not yet available in the
Android port. Do not hesitate to make any request in the development mailing
list:
